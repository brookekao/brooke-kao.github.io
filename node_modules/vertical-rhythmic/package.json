  "readme": "vertical-rhythmic 3.0.1\n=======================\n\nVertical-rhythmic is now a toolkit for responsive designing. It includes :\n\n- [fluid typography](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/05/fluid-typography/)\n- font optimizations\n- grid helper\n- [modular scale](https://github.com/modularscale/modularscale-sass) support\n- and vertical rhythms of course\n\nInstall\n-------\n\n```\nbower install vertical-rhythmic --save\nnpm install pyrsmk/vertical-rhythmic --save\n```\n\nQuick working example with modular scale\n----------------------------------------\n\n```scss\n// Set modular scale vars\n$ms-ratio: $major-second;\n$ms-base: 1em;\n\n// Set vertical-rhythm vars\n$vr-rhythm: ms(3);\n\nhtml {\n\t// Set our fluid typography\n\t@include vr-fluid(ms(0), ms(2), 30em, 100em);\n\t// Set the base line height for our rhythm\n\t// (we're stripping the unit to have a proportional line height)\n\tline-height: vr-strip(vr(1));\n\t// Add some basic font optimizations\n\t@include vr-optimize();\n}\n\n// Set a margin of 1 rhythm length\nmain {\n\tmargin: vr(1);\n}\n\n// Set a margin of 1 rhythm length,\n// but adapted for a font size of 3em\nh1 {\n\tfont-size: 3em;\n\tmargin: vr(1, 3em);\n}\n```\n\nFluid typography\n----------------\n\nIt is a good pratice to have a fluid typography instead of just changing the font size at responsive breakpoints (with `@media`). With fluid font sizing we can fill all the gaps between our breakpoints. To know more about this subject, you can read the [following article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/05/fluid-typography/).\n\nFirst, choose your minimum and maximum font sizes, and your minimum and maximum width breakpoints. The min/max font size will be reached when the min/max width will be reached too.\n\n```scss\nhtml {\n\t@include vr-fluid(16px, 20px, 480px, 1600px);\n}\n```\n\nOptimizations\n-------------\n\nIf you want, you can apply some font optimizations, that seems recommended.\n\n```scss\nhtml {\n\t@include vr-optimize();\n}\n```\n\nIt will print :\n\n```css\nhtml {\n\tfont-feature-settings: 'kern' 1;\n\tfont-kerning: normal;\n\t-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;\n\ttext-rendering: optimizeLegibility;\n}\n```\n\nGrid helper\n-----------\n\nThe grid is a well-known tool to align all our blocks against the rhythm. But it is currently inconsistent with fluid typography. As stated in this [codepen](https://codepen.io/MadeByMike/pen/bEEGvv) :\n\n> If the lines seem to glitch out occasionally it's not because the vertical rhythm is broken. I think it's because of the way the browser rounds. The height of the gradient background that draws the lines on the body element is only rounded once, whereas real line hight is rounded on a per element basis. This adds up by the time you get to the bottom of the page. No idea how to fix it!\n\nI came to the same conclusion and I have really no idea how to fix that too. So, it is a good idea to use a grid only on needed blocks, like `article`. That being said, you can show the grid with :\n\n```scss\nmain {\n\t@include vr-grid();\n}\n```\n\nSimplify your alignments with jellybeans.js\n-------------------------------------------\n\nSince the grid helper is not reliable enough, I've created a JS helper, to help us a bit : [jellybeans](https://github.com/pyrsmk/jellybeans). It emphasizes your different blocks by setting them a random background color.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nPublished under the [MIT license](http://dreamysource.mit-license.org).\n",
